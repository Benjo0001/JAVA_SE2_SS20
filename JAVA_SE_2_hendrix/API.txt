Deleting a File or Directory
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/delete.html

        The delete(Path) method deletes the file or throws an exception if the deletion fails. For example, if the file does not exist a NoSuchFileException is thrown. You can catch the exception to determine why the delete failed as follows:

        try {
            Files.delete(path);
        } catch (NoSuchFileException x) {
            System.err.format("%s: no such" + " file or directory%n", path);
        } catch (DirectoryNotEmptyException x) {
            System.err.format("%s not empty%n", path);
        } catch (IOException x) {
            // File permission problems are caught here.
            System.err.println(x);
        }
        The deleteIfExists(Path) method also deletes the file, but if the file does not exist, no exception is thrown. 
        Failing silently is useful when you have multiple threads deleting 
        files and you don't want to throw an exception just because one thread did so first.
